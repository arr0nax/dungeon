# dungeon
## a dungeon crawler
move around using the arrow keys. Rooms persist throughout the whole game, so be careful! On the 'enemy-gets-itmes' branch you can touch the walls but not the items. Your companion on the other hand can get items but will die if they touch a wall. Get to the next level by collecting the item in all nine rooms.
